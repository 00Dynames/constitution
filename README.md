# CSE Revue Constitution

**Goal**: to move the constitution from the pain that is a .docx file to something easier to read/edit/share, e.g. Markdown.
Maybe in the future we can have sections hyperlinked somehow so that we can easily follow-up references within the
constitution.

# TODO (tentative)
- upload current .docx constitution
- copy pasta each section of the constitution into seperate text files
- format each text file decently, Markdown (???) style
- proofread, make sure numbering/order etc is retained

# Format
- indents are two spaces
- retain numbering/dot-point format
